# Car-Price--Mini-Project

In this project, I have learnt on how to predict car price based on multiple variables like mileage and age. I have learnt how to split train and testing data and calculating accuracy of a model by using score. I have attached the code and dataset in this repository for references. This mini-project is a part of my Machine learning journey to help me understand the basics and implement my knowledge at the same time.
